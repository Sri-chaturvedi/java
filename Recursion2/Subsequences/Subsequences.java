/**
 * ðŸ“Œ Important Notes â€“ Generate Subsequences using Recursion
 *
 * 1. Definition:
 *    - A subsequence of a string is a sequence derived by deleting
 *      zero or more characters, without changing the relative order
 *      of remaining characters.
 *
 *    Example: "abc"
 *      Subsequences â†’ "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"
 *
 * 2. Approach (Recursion):
 *    - For each character, we have two choices:
 *         a) Include the character in the subsequence
 *         b) Exclude the character
 *    - Explore both choices recursively.
 *
 * 3. Base Case:
 *    - If idx == str.length(), print the subsequence formed so far.
 *
 * 4. Number of Subsequences:
 *    - For a string of length n â†’ 2^n subsequences.
 *
 * 5. Time Complexity: O(2^n)
 *    - Each character has 2 choices â†’ total subsequences = 2^n
 *    Space Complexity: O(n)
 *    - Due to recursive call stack.
