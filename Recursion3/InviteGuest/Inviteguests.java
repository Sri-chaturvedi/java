/**
 * ðŸ“Œ Important Notes â€“ Friends Pairing Problem (Invite Guests)
 *
 * 1. Problem:
 *    - There are `n` guests.
 *    - Each guest can either:
 *        âž¤ come alone, OR
 *        âž¤ come as a pair with any other guest.
 *    - You need to find the total number of ways to invite all guests.
 *
 * 2. Base Cases:
 *    - If n == 1 â†’ only 1 way (the guest comes alone)
 *    - If n == 0 â†’ 1 way (no guest)
 *
 * 3. Recursive Relation:
 *      For each guest, we have two choices:
 *        âž¤ Choice 1: Come alone â†’ f(n-1)
 *        âž¤ Choice 2: Pair up with (n-1) others â†’ (n-1) * f(n-2)
 *
 *      âœ… Total ways:
 *         f(n) = f(n - 1) + (n - 1) * f(n - 2)
 *
 * 4. Example:
 *      For n = 3:
 *          â†’ f(3) = f(2) + 2 * f(1)
 *                 = 2 + 2*1 = 4 ways
 *
 * 5. Time Complexity:
 *      - O(2^n) (recursive)
 *      - Can be optimized using DP or memoization to O(n)
 *
 * 6. Space Complexity:
 *      - O(n) (recursion stack)
 *
 * ðŸ§  Tip:
 *    This is similar to Fibonacci logic, but each term is weighted by (n-1).
